# Traffic Light Controller using 8051 (Keil + Proteus)

## Description:
This project simulates a basic traffic light system using the 8051 microcontroller. The code is written in Embedded C using Keil, and the simulation is done in Proteus.

## Tools Used:
- Keil µVision (for Embedded C programming)
- Proteus 8 Professional (for simulation)

## Components:
- 8051 Microcontroller
- traffic light

## Working:
1. RED → ON for 1 second  
2. YELLOW → ON for 0.5 second  
3. GREEN → ON for 1 second  
4. YELLOW again → ON for 0.5 second  
5. Repeats as a loop
